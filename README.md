# FuturePack-Language
Language-Files form FuturePack (Minecraft Mod)

Use the de_DE as reference or the en_US.

"German" will only be created by the mod developer (Wugi, McEnderdragon), and is the template for the other languages.

Please commit only files that are fully translated (no unchanged copies from other Languages, the mod use the English version whenever a file is missing or damaged)

For every Language, that get fully transalated (at least one time). We add it to the file: [https://github.com/Wugand/FuturePack-Language/blob/master/TODO_Transaltions.md]. There we inform about new or changed files, and in which language they are currently missing. Please add your name to the corresponding cells, if you translate a text for us (in the same pull-request). So we and others can see the progress and the todo's.

for more informations see also [how the Jasons work.md](https://github.com/Wugand/FuturePack-Language/blob/master/how%20the%20Json%20works.md)


Thank you for your help!

	"By composing Neonparts, working as small energy storages and an control device I desinges a meomory. The controler i build like a core of an silicon wafer contaminated by iron.",
	"This meomory design is very fast, but the data must by rewritten periodically. This cause by an energy loss of the small storages.",

	"Ram possess 1 critical property: Their speed (§lram§r), which tells the general spped of the system (refer Mainboard), and their cost (§lcorepower§r), which tells the performance needed from the processor."

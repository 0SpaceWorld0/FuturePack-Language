	"I have evolved the prototype of an Energy conductor. A combination of crystalline and refined Neon has result in the optimal conductor.",
	"This design is very unstable and pron for environmental impacts, so I covered it in an aluminum case.",
	"The cable can be placed free standing. I doesn't have to care about overloading or such things, because the neon conductors can transport gigantic amounts of energy without having traditional problems like voltage and current.",

	"My researches resulted in the fact that small quartz crystals can work both as a tact generator and a memory to permanently save once added information.",
	"In Combination with some controlling logic made of silicium and some energy conductor made of copper I constructed an universal chip set working mainly as a bridge connecting the processor and the surrounding outside world.",
	"However this logic chip set contains general program codes for the processor enabling the system start. Because of this any system will need one of those chip sets for the moment.",

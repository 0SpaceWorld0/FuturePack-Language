	"During the analysis of my latest generation of machines I noticed that they often won't use the best way of crafting, or that waste material remains",
	"Through minimal adaptations of their program I made it so they can analyse and document their own efficiency. The data created that way are stored as \"Support\"-points inside the machine.",
	"I can probably evaluate the gathered data sets of these \"intelligently\" working machines in my own further research, or use them to create even more intelligent machinery.",
	"If supplied with Support-points, I can also use the assembly table to build considerably better components.",
	"Info: The Supportgauge is (most of the times) on the right hand side of machinery GUI's, and yellow-colored. Information regarding transport and storage of said points can be found on the \"logistics\"-page.",
	"Note: New researchables available in \"logistics\"!",

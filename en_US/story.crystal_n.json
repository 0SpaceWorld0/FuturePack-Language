	"I found an bluish glowing Crystal. After some analyses i would categorisize this as an metalic Semiconductur-Crystal.",
	"Genesis:",
	"The Crystals grows, like the most cystaline structures under heat and pressure, with the result that they are only traceable bloew the ground. Usally they form an sandy fertile soil, which have similar characteristics as the crystals.",
	"Rafineration:",
	"Diffrent to diamonds, the crystal structures are mostly composed of Silicon, this cause that they don't burn at high temperatures. The melting point is at 1.400°C. The material can be refinend by heat them up with an reducing agent, like carbon in form of coal or gas. By this process the crystals are transformed to handy ingots.",
	"Characteristics:",
	"The neon-materials works best about 100°C. But they have a very low anelling temperature, so the most of them starts to glow at 18 - 32°C. THis is avery special characteristic and caused the name Neoncrysteal for the blue one I found. I think that there are must be more types of crystals."

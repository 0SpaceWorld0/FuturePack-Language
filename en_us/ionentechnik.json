	"Electricity also exists in the open air, which is especially evident in thunderstorms. There are very often charged particles in air. They are incomplete atoms, which I call ions.",
	"The plasma I already know is a gas with large amount of such ions. So I should continue to study these particles to understand conductive materials better. Maybe I can also collect ions from the air and convert them into usable energy."

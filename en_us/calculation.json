	"The energy-research needs alot of computing power, wich unfortunetly the researcher not have. That's why the researcher are getting very time consuming.",
	"So I invented a Calculationmodul, wich will help the researcher to calculate large amouns of data.	Because this modul doesn't need alot of different chipsets, I was able to change the system to incluse more ram-slots. And I have also included a second processor to process the data faster by communication with each other. Thus this system can reach more corepower than the normal machines",
	"The Calculationmodul have to be directly connected to the researcher or connected via the network (has yet to be researched).",
	"It is possible to connect any number of modules to a researcher, one module with 100% RAM has 4 times the calculation power of a normal researcher. The power of a module depends only on its ram power.",

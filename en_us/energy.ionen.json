  "Air friction, radiation, sunlight, and other influences create a certain amount of ions in the air. I can use a metal grid to collect these particles and convert them to neon energy using a modified solar panel.",
  "Especially many ions are produced during thunderstorms and strong solar radiation. The ion collector can convert them very efficiently and with this construction I can even produce energy at night.",

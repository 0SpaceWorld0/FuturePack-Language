#General

the Jsons are in a folder named after a Language and the Json itself is named after the research it represents. (just dont change the name and everything will work)

#Content of the Json

##Form
the Json must be a Array ( '[' at the begining and ']' at the end) and then just the translated Text in  " " .

##Special Content
in the Json are sometimes things with {} around them. We use them for crafting recipes and similar stuff just ignore them.
